A PyTorch implementation for precise pediatric Bone Age Assessment (BAA) based on hand radiographs.

This project utilizes a modern CNN architecture (ConvNeXt) combined with Generalized Mean (GeM) Pooling and specific optimizations for medical regression tasks. It achieves superior convergence and stability on the RSNA Pediatric Bone Age dataset compared to traditional baselines like ResNet or EfficientNet.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **SOTA Backbone**: Utilizes `ConvNeXt-Tiny` as the feature extractor, offering stronger feature representation for medical imaging analysis.
* **GeM Pooling**: Implements learnable Generalized Mean (GeM) Pooling instead of standard Average Pooling. This acts similarly to an attention mechanism, better capturing high-response features like crucial ossification centers.
* **Multi-Modal Fusion**: Integrates image features with gender encoding (male/female) to significantly improve prediction accuracy, as bone maturation rates differ by sex.
* **Numerical Stability**: Applies a `Sigmoid * Max_Age` (e.g., 240 months) scaling technique at the final output layer. This constraint eliminates physically impossible negative predictions and prevents gradient explosion, ensuring highly stable training dynamics.
* **AMP Support**: Implements Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) for faster training speeds and reduced GPU memory usage.

## 🛠️ Installation & Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BoneXage-assessment.git
    cd BoneXage-assessment
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    You can install the necessary libraries via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tqdm pillow
    ```
    Or, if you have a `requirements.txt` file provided:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 💿 Dataset Preparation

This project uses the RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Challenge dataset. Due to license restrictions, you must download the data yourself (e.g., from Kaggle).

Please organize your `data/` directory exactly as follows:

    data/
    ├── boneage-training-dataset/   # Directory containing training images (.png)
    ├── boneage-test-dataset/       # Directory containing test images (.png)
    ├── boneage-training-dataset.csv
    └── boneage-test-dataset.csv

## 🖥️ Usage

### 1. Training

Run `train.py` to start training the model. The script automatically detects available GPUs and utilizes `nn.DataParallel` for multi-GPU training if applicable.

```bash
python train.py
```
### 2. Inference (Prediction)
Use predict.py to predict bone age for a list of images.
Preparation: Create a text file (e.g., image_list.txt) containing the full paths to the images you want to predict, one per line:
data/test_imgs/1234.png
data/test_imgs/5678.png

python predict.py <image_list_filename> <sex(M/F)> [image_size] [model_path]

Output Example:
data/test_imgs/1234.png: 10 years 6 months (126.5 months)
data/test_imgs/5678.png: 13 years 2 months (158.1 months)
